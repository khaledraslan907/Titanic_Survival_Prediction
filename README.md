Titanic_Survival_Prediction_using_Logistic_Regression_Model
This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using a logistic regression model in Python. The steps undertaken in this project include:
# 1- Data Loading and Exploration: 
The dataset is loaded and inspected for any missing values or anomalies.
# 2- Data Cleaning: 
Missing values are addressed by dropping the 'Cabin' column and filling in missing values for the 'Age' and 'Embarked' columns.
# 3- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Visualizations are created to explore relationships between different features (e.g., Sex, Pclass, Age) and survival rates.
# 4- Feature Encoding:
Categorical variables such as 'Sex' and 'Embarked' are encoded to be used in the model.
# 5- Model Preparation: 
The data is split into features (X) and target (Y), followed by a split into training and testing sets.
# 6- Model Training:
A logistic regression model is trained on the training set.
# 7- Model Evaluation:
The accuracy of the model is evaluated on both the training and testing sets to assess its performance.
